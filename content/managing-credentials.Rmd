```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
```

Just like with every programming language, it is important to **avoing publishing code with your credentials in plain text**.  There are several options to protect your credentials in R.  In order of preference, starting with the best one, here are the methods that we will cover:

- Integrated security with DSN

- Integrated security without DSN

- Encrypt credentials with the `keyring` package

- Use a configuration file using the `config` package

- Environment variables using the `.Renviron` file

- Prompt for Credentials using the RStudio IDE.

## Integrated security with DSN

The very best scenario combine two factors that are usually out of the hands of the analyst:

1. There is integrated security between the terminal and the database, usually via Kerberos.

1. An ODBC connection has been pre-setup in the Desktop or Server by someone with sufficient access rights.  The ODBC connection will have a unique name called Data Source Name, or DSN.

```r
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "My DSN Name")

```

This is considered the best option, because no information about the database, other than an internal alias, connection is available in plan text code. 

## Integrated security without DSN

In cases where the analyst is not able to setup a DSN, or a quick prototype is needed, it is possible to pass the necessary connection settings as arguments to the `DBI::dbConnect` command.  With integrated security, there are 3 arguments that are typically required: *the driver name, the network path to the server (or cluster), and the database name*. Other arguments may be required depending on the type of database, in the example below passing the port number is needed for a connection with an Apache Impala database.

```r
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                   Driver = "impala", 
                   Host = "hadoop-cluster",
                   Schema = "default",
                   Port   = 21050)
```


## Encrypt credentials with `keyring`

The [keyring](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keyring) package uses the operating system's credential storage. It currently supports:

- Keychain on macOS,
- Credential Store on Windows,
- the Secret Service API on Linux


```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gaborcsardi/keyring")
```

### Keyrings and keys

Inside the credential store there are `keyrings` that contain multiple `keys`.  A `keyring` is secured with a single password, which then grants access to to all of its `keys`.  In our case, we will store a single database connection credential per `key`. We will use the default keyring, which is automatically un-locked when a user signs in.

### Our first key

A `key` has four main attributes:

- `service` - This is the key's unique identifier, we will use the database server's path for our keys.
- `keyring` - The key's 'parent' keyring. If not specified, the default keyring is used.
- `username`
- `password` 

The way `keyring` retrieves data is by passing the `keyring` name and a `service` name. If no `keyring` is passed, the default keyring is used.

We only create the key one time:

```{r}
keyring::key_set_with_value(service = "my-database", 
                            username = "myusername", 
                            password = "mypassword")
```

### Retrieve credentials

The `key_list()` command is used to retrieve the `username`:

```{r}
keyring::key_list("my-database")
```

To extract the only the `username`, so as to pass it inside the connection string, use:

```{r}
keyring::key_list("my-database")[1,2]
```

To extract the `password`, use `key_get()`:

```{r}
keyring::key_get("my-database")
```

These functions can be used to supply the database credentials without storing them in plain text or an environment variable:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), 
  Driver   = "SQLServer",
  Server   = "my-database",
  Port     = 1433,
  Database = "default",
  UID      = keyring::key_list("my-database")[1,2],
  PWD      = keyring::key_get("my-database"))
```

The default keyring is unlocked anytime the user is signed in. If a new keyring is created and used, the Operating System will prompt the user for the `keyring` password when the code executes.

## Stored in a file with `config`

The [config](https://github.com/rstudio/config) is meant to make it easier to [deploy content](/deployment/#deploying-with-config-package), but we also use it to keep the credential outside of the R script by saving them in the `config.yml` file.  In fact, all of the connection arguments can be saved in the `yml` file.


```r
  install.packages("config")
```

Here is an example `yml` file:

```ini
default:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: 'Postgres' 
    server: 'mydb-test.company.com'
    uid: 'local-account'
    pwd: 'my-password'  
    port: 5432
    database: 'regional-sales'
 
```

This is how the connection arguments would be called inside the R script:

```r

dw <- config::get("datawarehouse")

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc,
   Driver = dw$driver,
   Server = dw$server,
   UID    = dw$uid,
   PWD    = dw$pwd,
   Port   = dw$port,
   Database = dw$database
)
```


## Use Environment variables

The `.Renviron` file can be used to store the credentials and then retrieved via `Sys.getenv()`.  Here are the steps:

1. Create a new file defining the credentials

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    
    uid = "username"
    pwd = "password"
    
```
2. Save in your home directory with the filename `.Renviron`. If questioned, say **YES** you do want to use a filename that begins with a dot.

3. Note that by default dot files are usually hidden. But within RStudio, the file browser will make .Renviron visible and therefore easy to edit in the future.

4. Restart R. .Renviron is processed only at the start of an R session.

5. Retrieve the credentials using `Sys.getenv()` while opening the connection
```{r, eval = FALSE}
  con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
    Driver = "impala", 
    Host   = "database.rstudio.com",
    UID    = Sys.getenv("uid"),
    PWD    = Sys.getenv("pwd")
  )
```


## Prompt for Credentials

The [RStudio IDE's](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) API can be used to prompt the user to enter the credentials in a popup box that has masks what is typed:

<br/>
  <center><img src="/securing-credentials/prompt.png"> </center>
<br/>


```{r, eval = FALSE}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
  Driver = "impala", 
  Host   = "database.rstudio.com",
  UID    = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
  PWD    = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
)
```

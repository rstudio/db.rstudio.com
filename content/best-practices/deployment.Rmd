There are multiple ways to secure access to a database in deployed content. 

The types of content that we can deploy are: 

- Shiny Apps
- flexdashboards  
- RMarkdown documents

The most common methods are:

## Service Account

It is typical for shiny applications and R Markdown reports to provide insight
from data that is not directly accessible by the content audience. In these
1-to-many cases, it is common to define service accounts that access the
database on behalf of the content audience.  The previous examples assumed this
type of model.

Sometimes, during local development, the data scientist might be expected to use
their own credentials. It is possible through a DSN or the `config` package to
specify that local connections use the data scientist's credentials and deployed
connections use a service account. Be sure the code works for results for both
accounts!

## Query by User (Shiny)

Even when a service account is used, it is still possible to restrict access to
data using logic inside the application code. One option is to update the query
based on the logged-in user. The username is available in Shiny applications
through the `session$user` object. For example:

```r
library(shiny)
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "Datawarehouse")

# ... rest of shiny code 

server <- function(input, output, session) {
   data <- reactive({
       q <- "SELECT * FROM sales-data WHERE user == ?user"
       query <- sqlInterpolate(con, q, user = session$user)
       sqlGetQuery(con, query)
   })
   
   # ... some code that uses data()
}

```

## Prompt for Credentials (Shiny)

In Shiny it is also possible to prompt the user for their database credentials. For example:

```r
library(shiny)
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

# ... rest of shiny code 

server <- function(input, output, session) {
   data <- reactive({
      req(input$uid, input$pwd)
      con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
        Driver = "Postgres",
        Server = "mydb.company.com",
        Port = 5432,
        Database = "sales-data",
        UID = input$uid,
        PWD = input$pwd,
      )
      
      data <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM sales")
      
      dbDisconnect(con)
   
   })
   
   # ... some code that uses data()
}

```

## Run As the Logged-in User (Kerberos)

In rare cases, it may be necessary for the data to be accessed by the
application or report on behalf of the specific logged-in user without prompting
the user for their credentials.

This scenario is rare because it implies that each end user of the report or
application has an account and access controls in the database. In other words,
this model assumes a 1-to-1 model instead of the 1-to-many distribution model
facilitated by a service account.

In these scenarios, it is most common to use Kerberos. RStudio Connect will need
to be setup to run the application as the logged-in user. The [admin guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/process-management/#runas-current)
contains more details.

Deployment of this type of content is usually straightforward because the
connection code does not include any credentials, and is the same in the local
and deployed context.

For example:

```r
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
  Driver = "SQLServer",
  Database  = "Datawarehouse",
  trusted_connection = "True"
)
```

For more information on data access, see this [article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/236020708-Strategies-for-connecting-Shiny-applications-to-databases). In all cases, the
credentials should not be stored as plain text in either the configuration file
or the R code. See [securing credentials](/best-practices/managing-credentials/) for more details.

## Deploying with the `config` Package

An alternative to relying on DSNs is to use the [config](https://github.com/rstudio/config) package. The `config`
package allows the connection code in R to reference an external file that
defines values based on the environment. This process makes it easy to specify
values to use for a connection locally and values to use after deployment.

For example:

R code:

```r
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(config)

dw <- get("datawarehouse")

con <- dbConnect(
   Driver = dw$driver,
   Server = dw$server,
   UID    = dw$uid,
   PWD    = dw$pwd,
   Port   = dw$port,
   Database = dw$database
)
```

config.yml:

```ini
default:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: 'Postgres' 
    server: 'mydb-test.company.com'
    uid: 'local-account'
    pwd: 'my-password'  // not recommended, see alternatives below
    port: 5432
    database: 'regional-sales-sample'
    
rsconnect:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: 'PostgresPro'
    server: 'mydb-prod.company.com'
    uid: 'service-account'
    pwd: 'service-password' // not recommended, see alternatives below
    port: 5432
    database: 'regional-sales-full'
```

The `config` package determines the active configuration by looking at the
`R_CONFIG_ACTIVE` environment variable. By default, RStudio Connect sets
`R_CONFIG_ACTIVE` to the value  `rsconnect`. In the config file above, the
default datawarehouse values would be used locally and the datawarehouse values
defined in the `rsconnect` section would be used on RStudio Connect.
Administrators can optionally customize the name of the active configuration
used in Connect.

## Credentials inside Environment Variables in RStudio Connect

Starting with version 1.6, RStudio Connect allows R [Environment Variables](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/security-and-auditing/#application-environment-variables) to be saved at the application level.  The variables are encrypted on-disk, and in-memory.

The recommended approach would be to use an `.Renviron` file in your local session of R, which can be used to store the credentials, and then retrieved with `Sys.getenv()`.  Here are the steps:

1. Create a new file defining the credentials:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    userid = "username"
    pwd = "password"
    ```
2. Save it in your home directory with the file name `.Renviron`. If you are asked whether you want to save a file whose name begins with a dot, say **YES**.

3. Note that by default, dot files are usually hidden. However, within RStudio, the file browser will make .Renviron visible and therefore easy to edit in the future.

4. Restart R. .Renviron is processed only at the start of an R session.

5. Retrieve the credentials using `Sys.getenv()` while opening the connection:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
      Driver = "impala", 
      Host   = "database.rstudio.com",
      UID    = Sys.getenv("userid"),
      PWD    = Sys.getenv("pwd")
    )
    ```

6. Develop the app or document and deploy to RStudio Connect.  Make sure to leave the `.Renviron` file out of the deployment process.

7. In RStudio Connect, select the `{X} Vars` tab

8. Click on `Add Environment Variable` blue button

9. Create each the password and user ID variables

## `DBI` support is key

Connecting to a database with a method that supports the [DBI](/dbi) package provides the following advantages:

- A consistent set of functions that work across all connections
- Makes using [dplyr](/dplyr) as a front-end possible

Mostly based on how difficult is to setup, the order of preference of connection methods is:


1. Native database driver implemented in **database package** (e.g. [RPostgresSQL](/databases/postgresql)). To see the list of known database packages check out the [Databases](/databases) page.
1. **ODBC** as implemented in [odbc](/odbc) package
1. **JDBC** as implemented in [RJDBC](http://www.rforge.net/RJDBC/) package

If there is a need to connect to several databases in one or several R projects, then it would be preferable to use **ODBC** for all connections because it increases consistency.

Additionally, using the [odbc](/odbc) package inside the RStudio IDE will enable the use of the [Connections Pane](/tooling/connections/)

## FAQ

### Do I need to replace all of my existing JDBC connections, in favor of ODBC connections?

Not necessarily, if there are existing R jobs that successfully run on a regular basis then there's no need to introduce risk, in other words *if it ain't broke, don't fix it*.  

For new projects, if using ODBC is still not a viable option, then using an R package that implements a `DBI` back-end for the JDBC connection will be advisable, like `RJDBC`.  There are other packages that implement both a DBI back-end for a JDBC connection and a `dplyr` translation, such as [implyr](https://github.com/ianmcook/implyr) for Impala connections. 

### Currently, I use `RODBC`, should I consider switching to `odbc`?

For new projects, yes.  Switching will enable `dplyr` interactivity, and the Connections Pane inside the RStudio IDE (see the previous section for more info).

Existing projects may need to be individually vetted to see if the possible increase in performance that the `odbc` package may provide is worth making coding changes.

Title: Databases using R

##**dplyr** as a database interface

The `dplyr` package simplifies data transformation. It provides a consistent set of functions, called verbs, that can be used in succession and interchangeably to gain understanding of the data iteratively.

`dplyr` is able to **interact with databases directly** by translating the `dplyr` verbs into SQL queries. This convenient feature allows you to ‘speak’ directly with the database from R. Other advantages of this approach are:

 1. **Run data exploration routines over all of the data**, instead of importing part of the data into R.

 2. **Use the SQL Engine to run the data transformations.**  In effect, computation is being pushed to the database.

 3. **Collect into R only a targeted dataset.** 

 4. **All of your code is in R.**  Because`dplyr` is used to communicate with the database, there is no need to alternate between languages or tools to perform the data exploration.

## **Connect to a database**

**At the center of this approach is the `DBI` package.** This package acts as *‘middle-ware’* between packages to allow connectivity with the database from the user or other packages. It provides a consistent set of functions regardless of the database type being accessed. The `dplyr` package depends on the `DBI` package for communication with databases.

There are packages that enables a direct connection between the an open-source database and R. Currently, such packages exist for the following databases: *MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and bigquery*.

Most commercial databases, like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server, offer ODBC drivers that allow you to connect your tool to the database. Even though there are R packages that allow you to use ODBC drivers, the connection will most likely not be compatible with `DBI`. The new `odbc` package solves that problem by providing a `DBI` backend to any ODBC driver connection. 

If you are interested in creating your own package that connects `DBI` to a database, please review the article [DBI Backend](backend).

## SQL Translations for `dplyr`

A complementary package called `dbplyr` contains the translations of the vendor-specific SQL for `dplyr` to use. As of today, we have translations for the following databases:

  - <img src="/logos/mssql.png", width = 50, height = 50> [Microsoft SQL Server](microsoft-sql-server)
  - <img src="/logos/oracle.png", width = 50, height = 50>  [Oracle](oracle)
  - <img src="/logos/hive.png", width = 50, height = 50> [Apache Hive](hive)
  - <img src="/logos/impala.png", width = 50, height = 50> [Apache Impala](impala)
  - <img src="/logos/postgresql.png", width = 50, height = 50> [PostgreSQL](postgresql)

In the development version of `dbplyr`, we also have translations for:

  - <img src="/logos/redshift.png", width = 50, height = 50> [Amazon Redshift](redshift)


Is the database you are interested in not listed here? You can still use `DBI` and `odbc` to connect and send SQL queries.  If you would like to contribute a translation, please see the [SQL Translation](translation) page in this website.

## 2. Install RStudio's ODBC drivers 

RStudio provides production quality drivers to connect to the following databases:

| |
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --

Red Shift | Big Query | Cassandra | Couchbase | Drill | Dynamo
![](hbaselarge.png) | ![](hivelarge.png) | ![](impalalarge.png) | ![](mongodblarge.png) | ![](oraclelarge.png) | ![](phoenixlarge.png) 
HBase | Hive | Impala | Mongo | Oracle | Phoenix
![](postgresql.png) | ![](prestolarge.png) | ![](salesforcelarge.png) | ![](sparklarge.png) | ![](sqlserverlarge.png)
Postgres | Preso | SelsForce | Spark | MSSQL |

To simplify the process, RStudio has setup a download location and installation script. 

**Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS Linux (6.0+)**

- There are two system dependencies that need to be installed prior to installing the drivers
```bash
sudo yum install wget
sudo yum install unixODBC
``` 

- The following script will download and install the drivers:
```bash
# Placeholder path
wget -O - https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rstudio-odbc/...
```


## 3. Install the **odbc** package

The [odbc](https://github.com/rstats-db/odbc) package provides a consistent interface for the RStudio's ODBC drivers.  In other words, this is the package that connects the drivers to R.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstats-db/odbc")
```

To confirm that the `odbc` package and the RStudio's drivers have been correctly installed click on the `New Connection` button, located in the `Connections` tab, to see the the the databases listed along with their respective logo:

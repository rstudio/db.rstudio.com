**RStudio** makes it as easy to work with databases in R. This work focuses on **three key areas**:

</div>

### 1. RStudio products

- The new RStudio [Connections Pane](/connections) makes it possible to easily connect to a variety of data sources, and **explore the objects and data** inside the connection 
- To RStudio commercial customers, we offer [RStudio Professional ODBC Drivers](/tooling/pro-drivers), these are data connectors that help you connect to some of the most popular databases.

### 2. R packages

Build and/or document how to use packages such as: [dplyr](/dplyr), [DBI](/dbi), [odbc](/odbc), [keyring](/best-practices/managing-credentials/) and [pool](/r-packages/pool)


### 3. Education

This website is the main channel to provide support in this area.  RStudio is also working through other delivery channels, such as upcoming webinars and in-person training during our RStudio conferences.

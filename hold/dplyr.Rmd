After connecting R to a database, we have to tackle the challenge manipulating data using two languages, R and SQL. 

The **dplyr** package simplifies data wrangling of in-memory data in R, and is also able to do this with remote databases when used in combination with the **dbplyr** package.  

In the background, the *dbplyr* package translates the *dplyr* commands into *SQL* commands, thus allowing us to start and end a data analysis using R code only!

The main goal should be to push as much of the aggregating and filtering to the database and to bring back as little data as possible into R memory.

If new to dplyr, please start by reviewing package's official site: http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

## Package installation

We will start by installing both packages from **CRAN**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The install commands will be replaced when both packages are up-to-date in CRAN
devtools::install_github("hadley/dbplyr")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")
```


```{r, include = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
library(odbc)
library(config)
library(DBI)

db <- config::get("mssql")

con <- DBI::dbConnect(
  odbc::odbc(),
  Driver = db$Driver,
  Server = db$Server,
  Host = db$Host,
  SVC = db$SVC,
  Database = db$Database,
  Schema = db$Schema,
  UID  = db$UID,
  PWD = db$PWD,
  Port = db$Port)

```



## The data

We have pre-loaded the *flights*, *airlines* and *airports* datasets from the *nycflights13* package into tables inside a Microsoft SQL database. The *Connections* pane in the **RStudio IDE** shows the tables currently available in the database:

## Referencing tables

The simplest way to preview a table with *dplyr* is by using the `tbl()` command.  

```{r, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)

tbl(con, "flights")
```

The table preview's header also displays information about the database, such as *type*, *version*, *server name*, *user ID* and *database name*.

## 'Laziness'

Notice that the following command does not return an output.  The `flights_count` variable is not a data frame in our environment.  

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights_count <- tally(tbl(con, "flights"))
```

The resulting SQL statement will not be executed until we ask R to do something with the variable, which is why is called 'lazy'. Because calling the variable inside the R Markdown code chunk triggers a 'preview' of the variable, is up until this point that the query is executed.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights_count
```

## Resulting SQL

To take a look behind the scenes, we can use the `show_query()` command to see what is the SQL statement that *dplyr* will execute. This is not something that we will do on a regular basis, but we are including it in this example to provide an idea what the packages are doing.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
show_query(flights_count)
```

## Grouping data & commands

We can group multiple commands connected with what we call *pipes*, which look like this `%>%`. For our purposes, the SQL statement will be built based on how we sequence specific dplyr commands.  The package that does this is called [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html), and it is automatically loaded when we call the dplyr library.

To group data, we use dplyr's `group_by()` command, which allows us to group one or more fields.

The following code retrieves the *total number of flights by carrier*.  We start with the *flights* table by using `tbl()`, then `group_by()` the `carrier` field, and get the record count using `tally()`.  The SQL translation will more likely not be sequenced in the same way, but that's taken cared of by the translation inside *dbplyr*.


```{r, cache = TRUE}
tbl(con, "flights") %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  tally
```

## Joining tables

Combining different datasets is a common practice in data analysis, and the way dplyr helps us with this is by providing *join* commands that combines two data sets.  Just like in SQL, dplyr provides multiple types of joins: `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `full_join()`, `right_join()`. RStudio has authored a [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf) which includes a section that makes it easier to visualize how the joins work.

We will join the *airlines* table with the *flights* table so we can get the actual name of the airline instead of the code:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
tbl(con, "flights") %>%
  left_join(tbl(con, "airlines"), by = "carrier") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  tally %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```


## Retrieve results

As mentioned at the top of this page, our main goal should be to push as much as much of the data wrangling to the database and to retrieve into R as small data as possible, like summarized results.  To retrieve the results from the database, we will use the `collect` command:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
carrier_totals <- tbl(con, "flights") %>%
  left_join(tbl(con, "airlines"), by = "carrier") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  tally %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  collect

head(carrier_totals)
```

After running the code above, we finally have our first dataframe loaded to our R environment. All of the data transformations on top of the over 300K records happened in the database, and we  brought back only 16 records into memory.

## Visualization

The preferred approach for visualization is to perform the aggregations inside the database and bring the results back into R for visualization.  Here will use the *ggplot2* package to visualize the `carrier_totals` data frame:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = carrier_totals) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(name, n), y = n), stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()

```

## Learn more

There are more data transformation verbs in *dplyr* than the ones covered in this page:

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

The [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) book and the [Data Transformation Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf) are two great resources to dive deeper into *dplyr*.


```{r, include = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
